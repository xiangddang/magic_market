# Magic-Market MERN project
This is the final project for the CS5610 Web Development course, which I completed in August 2023. Originally, this project was hosted on my private repository within my Khoury College GitHub account. To facilitate further improvements and updates to the project, I have migrated it to my personal GitHub account.

The project has already been deployed using Google App Engine and is accessible via the [link](https://magicmarket-frontend-neu.uk.r.appspot.com/).
